%% s_predictMeasuredRadiance
%
% Predict the radiance that we should measure of a slide with purported
% fluorophore when illuminated with a light
%
% To make this prediction, we use the following information
% 1. The excitation and emission spectra of the fluorophore
%       The excitation spectral curve (vector) describes how effective each wavelength is at
%       generating the emission
%       The emission spectral curve (vector) describes the spectral energy in the emitted light.
% 2. The spectral energy in the illuminating light
% 3. The spectral transmittance of the filter placed on the spectroradiometer
%       The fluorescence is small relative to the energy in the reflected
%       light, and the spetroradiometer cannot measure both the reflected light
%       and the fluorescence.  Hence, we use a Y44 filter to block light that is
%       great then 425 nm.  Presumably, this also blocks the Raman scattering of
%       the light as well
%
% To calculate the predicted radiance
% 1. Read in a fluorophore and create an excitation emission matrix (EEM)
% 2. Read in the light and take the product of the EEM and the light to get
%       the expected radiance
% 3. Multiply the expected radiance with the longpass filter to remove
% light that is not passed to the spectrophotometer
